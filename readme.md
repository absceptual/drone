# Drone

Drone is a passion project of mine to attempt to learn a mix of web development and networking. I've tried to use as little libraries as possible and dive into the unabstracted parts so I can really understand what I am doing

There are two different parts to ``Drone``

## Server

Although this section is the server, there's two subsections: the actual server itself which handles the transfer process, and the web panel.

### Panel
The purpose of the panel is to provide an easy way to upload an dll
(tbd)..
